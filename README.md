### Tableau data roles

### Dimensions and Measures

* (BLUE) Dimensions contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data).
We can use dimensions to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data.
Dimensions affect the level of detail in the view.

* (GREEN) Measures contain numeric, quantitative values that we can measure.
Measures can be aggregated.
When we drag a measure into the view, Tableau applies an aggregation to that measure (by default).
